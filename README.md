This tool is just a little thing I put together to speed up the reformatting of my interlinear translation of the book Demian from German to English. The book has been [available since 2012](https://www.lulu.com/shop/hermann-hesse-and-david-macleod/demian-an-interlinear-translation/paperback/product-20351542.html?page=1&pageSize=4), but back then the formatting was just done by me by mashing the spacebar as I couldn't program in anything then. Copying and pasting it results in something like this:

    mein Ziel im Leben war, so wie
    my        goal      in          life          was,    just    like
    mein Vater und meine Mutter zu werden, so hell und rein, so
    my         father      and          my            mother       to       become,        so   bright    and     clean,     so

So this tool is to break them down into individual words and let me just use the arrow keys and enter to properly sort them into this format:

    mein|my
    Ziel|goal
    im|in
    Leben|life

I go over the code in a video here for the curious:
